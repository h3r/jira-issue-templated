I found the necesity to update the plugin to support templates, sadly when I wanted to update the repo found is in typescript and I'm lazy as F. 
If you feel interesting feel free to test and even update https://github.com/marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue accordingly. :) 

## Changes:
* Added template path in settings. Upon clicking "+" in table, will use this template contents, works great with Templater
* Added target folder for new notes, this way you can organize better your notes :) 


## Installation:
* Download manually from the releases
* Move to / replace contents from `<your vault folder>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-jira-issue` with the contents of the zip file
* Enable plugin as normal
* Set template and path in plugin settings
